# advent-of-code


This is my attempt at AoC.

2021 -> it's my first AoC and first time writing in rust so we'll see how it goes :)

Update at the end of AoC 2k21:

So, turns out rust is a really nice language and AoC is super fun. I really enjoyed the entire journey. There were some tough parts where I was short on time and I had to adjust my coding style to fit rust paradigms, but at the end it was all worth it :)

2022 -> 2nd AoC, in rust again :)
